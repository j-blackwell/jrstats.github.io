Data Engineer at [Ember](www.ember-climate.org)

## Profile üåç

I'm a data engineer with experience in data science and platform architecture across the water and energy sector.
I like building things related to data and hate doing things manually!
I also like doing things the right way, using best practices and the right tool for the job.

I am passionate about the environment.
The fight against climate change is the problem of our generation and I'm motivated to use my skills in the most valuable way to combat it.

## Hobbies ü•Ö

#### Floorball

At uni I picked up a strange sounding sport when I decided that ¬£600+ for a set of ice hockey gear was too much for a first year student.
Cast your mind back to the plastic hockey sticks and balls that you played with in junior school and imagine that someone made this into a real sport - [dramatic video explanation for anyone who's interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erB_FWi9-T8).
It's not that popular in the UK (let's face it, the name doesn't help), but has a great following in north and central Europe.
The plus-side of playing a sport that no-one in your country has heard of, is that the pool of players for the national team is very small.
So as a result, I've been lucky enough to represent Great Britain in 14 matches, scoring 4 goals in this time.



#### Nerdy stuff
I enjoy doing some hobby programming when I can find the time.
I've been looking at this year's advent of code slowly and steadily. You can take a look at my solutions to this year's problems on my [github](https://github.com/jrstats/adventofcode/tree/main/2022) page.
When I've had a bit more time, I've also created most of a smart mirror in python, set up email notifications whenever [@BrentfordFC](https://twitter.com/BrentfordFC/) (COYB!) [tweet about tickets going on sale](https://github.com/jrstats/twitterNotifications), and [optimised the Formula 1 calendar](https://github.com/jrstats/f1calendar/blob/master/solution.ipynb) to reduce its emissions. Again, feel free to take a look at them on my [github](https://github.com/jrstats) page.


I'm also a fan of the Linux desktop, currently sporting the latest Fedora release. I love the open-source philosophy, and I'd like to contribute to open-source projects in the future.
