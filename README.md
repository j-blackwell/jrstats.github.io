Senior Data Consultant at [Aiimi](https://www.aiimi.com). 

## Profile üåç

I'm currently in my 5th year of professional experience.
I've worked as a data scientist and data engineer across the utilities and information sectors.
I like building things related to data and hate doing things manually - if I can write some code to automate a tedious or repetitive process, I definitely will!
I also like doing things the right way, using best practices and the right tool for the job.

I am passionate about the environment.
The fight against climate change is the problem of our generation and I'm keen to use my skills in the most valuable way to combat it.

I've worked on both data science and engineering projects whilst at Aiimi.

It has been within an agile framework and has involved plenty of business user engagement throughout.

I always have a focus beyond day-to-day delivery and have helped introduce good practices and work accelerators whilst on my projects.

## Hobbies ü•Ö

#### Floorball

At uni I picked up a strange sounding sport when I decided that ¬£600+ for a set of ice hockey gear was too much for a first year student.
Cast your mind back to the plastic hockey sticks and balls that you played with in junior school and imagine that someone made this into a real sport.
It's not that popular in the UK (let's face it, the name doesn't help), but has a great following in north and central Europe.
The plus-side of playing a sport that no-one in your country has heard of, is that the pool of players for the national team is very small.
I've been lucky enough to represent Great Britain in 14 matches, scoring 4 goals in this time.


#### Nerdy stuff
I enjoy doing some hobby programming when I can find the time.
Recently, I've looked at creating code for a smart mirror in python, and setting up email notifications whenever [@BrentfordFC](https://twitter.com/BrentfordFC/) (COYB!) tweet about tickets going on sale. You can find the link to my github page below where you can also find some of the other projects that I've worked on.

I'm also a fan of the Linux desktop, currently sporting the latest Fedora release. I love the open-source philosophy, and I'd like to contribute to open-source projects in the future.
